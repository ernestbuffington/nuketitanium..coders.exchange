Base Requirements
-----------------

In order to setup PHP-Nuke the folowing prerequisits are necessary.

- A Linux or Windows Box installed and working properly.
- Apache 2.4 Web Server (http://www.apache.org)
- PHP version 8.x.x or better (mod_php) Apache module (http://www.php.net)
- Maria database server 10.3.3 or higer

The above doesn't mean it will not work with other configurations, OS's, DB's, etc,
but we only provide INSTALL instructions for the above configuration.
In fact PHP-Nuke works under Windows (all), FreeBSD, OS/2, MacOS, etc.

Setup of these required packages is beyond the scope of this document
and if you are unsure you should check with each of the appropriate web
sites for further details.

Installing the Package 
----------------------------------------------
Unzip the package into the directory you want to use on you web
server, if you're unsure where that is, ask you system administrator.
Point your browser to your site, for example: http://phpnuke.org

The system will show you an error message with a link to the web based installer utility (introduced
with PHP-Nuke 8.0), follow the very easy steps and you're done.
